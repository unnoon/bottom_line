# bottom_line.js

Javascript utility belt that is as consistent as possible with the standard javascript syntax as possible without polluting native objects.
It takes a middle ground between something like sugar & underscore/lodash. It does extend native objects but does so in the way most libraries add a global namespace to the root object.
Adding a namespace object on the native prototype '_' not polluting it in any other way.
